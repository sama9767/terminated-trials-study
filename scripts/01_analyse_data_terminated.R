# Script Documentation: Processing Terminated ClinicalTrials.gov Trials

# Description:
# This script processes the ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials with a "Terminated" status. 
# It utilizes historical entries for these trials obtained using the 'cthist' package by BG Carlisle. 


# Input:
# The dataset should contain relevant information about the trials, including trial ID (nctid) and its recruitment status ('recruitment_status')
# The input data should be the ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials with a "Terminated" status in registry. 

# Functions
# The script uses duration_of_trial and degree_of_enrollment function
# duration_of_trial generates number of days trial was ongoing until termination (i.e trial_days)
# degree_of_enrollment generates percentage of enrollment for particular terminated trial (i.e enrollment_percentage)

# Output:
# The output dataset includes the following variables for each terminated trial:
# - nctid: Trial ID
# - start_date: Date when the trial was started
# - stop_date: Date when the trial's overall status was first updated to "Terminated" in the registry
# - why_stopped: The reason for trial termination
# - has_summary_result_ctgov: Boolean indicating whether summary results are available on ClinicalTrials.gov for the trial
# - anticipated_enrollment: The expected number of participants that the trial aims to enroll
# - actual_enrollment: The observed number of participants who are actually enrolled
# - trial_days : The number of days was ongoing until termination
# - enrollment_percentage : The percentage of enrollment achieved until termination

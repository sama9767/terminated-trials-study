#' This script is based on '01_analyse_data_terminated.R' and generates following variables 
#' for terminated trials in Contrast dataset (link:https://github.com/maia-sh/california-trials)
#
# - nctid: Trial ID
# - start_date: Date when the trial was started
# - stop_date: Date when the trial's overall status was first updated to "Terminated" in the registry
# - why_stopped: The reason for trial termination
# - has_summary_result_ctgov: Boolean indicating whether summary results are available on ClinicalTrials.gov for the trial
# - anticipated_enrollment: The expected number of participants that the trial aims to enroll
# - actual_enrollment: The observed number of participants who are actually enrolled
# - trial_days : The number of days trial was ongoing until termination
# - enrollment_percentage : The percentage of enrollment achieved until termination
